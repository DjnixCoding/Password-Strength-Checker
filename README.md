# Password-Strength-Checker
Description:
This program evaluates the strength of a user-inputted password based on its length. It provides feedback on whether the password is weak, moderate, or strong, encouraging users to create more secure passwords.

Requirements:
Python 3.x installed on your system

Steps to Run:
Save the script as password_strength_checker.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script using the command: python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password when prompted. The program will analyze the strength of your password and provide feedback.
If the password is too weak, the program will prompt you to enter a longer password until a sufficient strength level is reached.

Limitations:
Length-Based Only: This program only checks password strength based on length. It does not consider other crucial factors such as dynamic complexes (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) or common password patterns.
Educational Use Only: This tool is meant for educational purposes and should not be used for assessing real-world security measures.
Not a Secure Password Validator: The program does not enforce best security practices for password management and should not be relied upon for securing sensitive accounts.

Ethical Considerations and Responsible Use:
Avoid Misuse: This tool is intended to help users understand the importance of password length but should not be used to assure security.
Security Awareness: Users should be encouraged to use a proper password manager and adhere to security guidelines beyond just password length.
Enhancements Recommended: If adapting this tool for real-world use, consider integrating additional security checks such as entropy calculations.
